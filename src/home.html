                <p class="kira">    My name is Kantai Daulet. I'm 19 years old. My house is located in the western part of Astana (the outskirts of the city), in the Urker district. I study at Astana IT University. I go to bed at 11 p.m. and make sure that I get exactly 8 hours of sleep, no matter what.Before going to bed, I drink warm milk, and also spend twenty minutes warming up, so I sleep until morning without any problems.I wake up in the morning feeling neither tired nor stressed, like a baby.I'm trying to convey that I'm an ordinary person who wants to live a quiet life. I don't bother my head with problems like victories or defeats, and I don't make enemies that would keep me awake. I know for sure that happiness lies in this way of interacting with society. Although, if I had to fight, I wouldn't lose to anyone.</p>
